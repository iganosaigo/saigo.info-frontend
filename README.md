IganoSaigo's personal website running on React, FastAPI and Sqlalchemy. Frontend part.

**Note**: I've created this repository for my own use. It is neither a template, nor a theme. But you feel free to take whatever inspiration you want. If you looking for stack or template for your own blog then you definitly should look on [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com) or [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) or similar. Perhaps these are more apropriate for your purpose since they are working in SSR area whereas this project is **NOT**.

Currently it is at a **very** early stage. Initial version developed as fast as i could. So there are many critical improvements required. Especialy auth section and user management need to be taking care of...
